# Human Readable Ordered List (aka Index) Guidelines
Query numbering follows the *(Q + rule number)* format to make each Live Query easily referencable.

| Index Range | Topic |
| ----------- | ----- |
| 3000 - 3999 | macOS queries only applicable to Apple macOS. |

Refer to the [query index](query_index.md) for desriptions of each Live Query.

Each index is further broken down into specific sub-groups.
(i.e., Q3174 would be live queries focused on process visibility only for macOS.)
